# Tesla El Rapportering for Arduino YUN

This project will build upon the "Tesla_Ethernet_El_Rapport" project.
It will be created for the features provided by the linux kernel on the
Arduino YUN microcontroller.

This means, that mesured and calculated data will be written into a CSV file
on the linux system. This CSV file can then be imported directly into a spreadscheed.
